Add multiple currencies to Paid Memberships Pro.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add multiple currencies to the Paid Memberships Pro plugin. This will enable you to specify a different currency per membership level, or it will just use the default currency setting if left empty.

Please note:
- This is not an official add on from the PMPro team.
- Feel free to let us know if there are any outstanding pages.
